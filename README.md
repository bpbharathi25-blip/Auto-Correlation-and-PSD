## AUTO-CORRELATION-AND-PSD
## Aim
Write a program for Autocorrelation and Power Spectral Density (PSD) of signals in Scilab and verify the Wiener–Khinchin relation.

## Equipments Needed
   ->Computer with Intel i3 processor (or higher)
   ->Scilab software
## Theory
The Wiener–Khinchin theorem states that:

The Power Spectral Density (PSD) of a wide-sense stationary random process is the Fourier Transform of its autocorrelation function.

This relationship bridges the time-domain correlation and frequency-domain power representations of a signal.

## Algorithm
1. Load or Define the Signal: Input your time-domain signal.
2. Compute Autocorrelation: Calculate the autocorrelation function of the signal.
3. Compute Power Spectral Density (PSD):
   Estimate the PSD using either:
        ->Fourier Transform of the autocorrelation function, or
         ->Methods like Welch’s periodogram.
4. Plot Results: Visualize both the autocorrelation function and PSD.
## Procedure
1. Refer to the algorithm and write the code for the experiment.
2. Open Scilab on your system.
3. Type your code in a new editor.
4. Save the file.
5. Execute the code.
6. If any errors occur, debug and re-run the program.
7. Verify the generated waveform using tabulation and model waveform comparison.

## Result:
Thus the Autocorrelation and PSD are executed in Scilab and output is verified.
